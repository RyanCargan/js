Wrapper and/or shim for `customElements` with a similarly-shaped API. Keeps track of which classes and tags have already been defined, enabling idempotent registration and name salting. In browsers it also calls `customElements.define`. Note that it doesn't "patch" the global. Directly using global `customElements` bypasses our registration mechanisms and may lead to redundant registration attempts.
