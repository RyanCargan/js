## Overview

{{codeHead}} provides tools for string manipulation. Stuff missing from JS built-ins. Some of the features:

* Unicode-aware word splitting and case conversion.
* Unicode-aware truncation and ellipsis.
* Sanity-checked parsing of booleans and numbers.
  * Unlike built-in `parseFloat` and `parseInt`, this library requires an entire string to be a valid input, without truncating the rest.

## Perf

Written carefully and with benchmarks, but doesn't claim to be optimal at what it does. When in doubt, measure and compare.

## Usage

Example case conversion:

```js
import * as s from '{{featUrl}}'

s.words(`oneTwoThree`).title().snake() === `One_Two_Three`

s.words(`ΕΝΑ_ΔΥΟ_ΤΡΙΑ`).lower().kebab() === `ενα-δυο-τρια`
```

## Misc

Nil tolerance rules:

  * Funs that take and return strings allow nil input.
  * Funs that answer questions about strings require strings.
