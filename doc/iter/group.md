Signature: `(Iter<A>, A => Key | any) => {[Key: A[]]}`.

Takes an arbitrary iterable compatible with {{link iter values}} and groups its values by keys generated by the given function. The function is called for each value. If the function returns a {{link lang isKey valid_key}}, the value is added to the index under that key. Invalid keys are ignored.

Compare {{link iter index}}, which keeps only the last value for each group.
