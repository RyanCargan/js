True for any of:

  * {{link lang isArr Array}}
  * {{link lang isList List}}
  * {{link lang isSet Set}}
  * {{link lang isIterator Iterator}}

Many functions in `iter.mjs` support arbitrary data structures compatible with {{link iter values}}, but some functions such as {{link iter arr}} allow only sequences, for sanity checking.
