## Overview

{{codeHead}} provides tiny utils for iteration and functional programming. Lightweight replacement for Lodash. Features:

  * Higher-order functions for data structures.
    * Common FP tools like `map`, `filter`, and many more.
    * Compatible with arbitrary iterables such as lists, sets, maps, dicts.

Differences from Lodash:

  * Supports arbitrary iterables and iterators, including sets and maps.
  * Much smaller and simpler.

Port and rework of https://github.com/mitranim/fpx.

## Usage

```js
import * as i from '{{featUrl}}'
```

## Perf

Carefully tuned for performance. Functions covered by benchmarks appear comparable to their native or Lodash equivalents. Many appear significantly faster.

JS performance is complicated and _very_ unstable, Our benchmark suite is limited and checked only in V8. When in doubt, measure in your particular environment.
